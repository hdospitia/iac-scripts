# iac-tools-installation-scripts

In this repo you will find useful installation scripts of IaC tools (and others related) like Packer, Terraform, Vagrant, Docker and Oracle VirtualBox.
Those scripts were tested and deployed over Ubuntu, Fedora and Rocky Linux distros.

I'll be sure of apply the proper updates for each one of those. All your feedback is welcome!

Clone, install and start coding your infra!
